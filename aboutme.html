<p id="overview">
    I started coding on a TI-82 as a kid and have been coding since the 1990's.</p>
<hr/>
<p>
When I learned AutoCAD, my passion to create grew in the field of design.

Coding and design grew to be a hobby, in my spare time for the personal challenge.

I have earned certifications throughout the years, have taken college classes, and  have a longstanding knowledge in coding, design, and script.

In college I learned XHTML, at the time it was how you created CSS. I know old school. But have kept up and recently updated my certificates to HTML5 and CSS3 (since these are the industry standard).  

While I have learned and worked with both Python and JavaScript throughout the years, I am currently in the process of acquiring certifications for both, beyond a self taught knowledge. I believe that my personal use and the training/certificates show a deep sub code running in my veins. 



For my own mental calisthenics I have been programming my own game in my free time and have enjoyed dabbling in photogrammetry. 

My passion is and has been designing.  I would welcome the opportunity to prove my passion:

In well thought-out and properly executed designs!

 I believe with the right tools and my strong work ethic, together we can create!</p>

       <h4> A little more about me:</h4>
       <h6>High School</h6>
       <p>I started out in high school learning drafting and design. after the first year of board drafting (hand drawn on velium and a blueprinting machine), i went and took AutoCAD. I took this for 2 years in school learning the basics and advanced course. The teacher was Mr. Redding, and he taught woodshop and drafting &and; design. I learned how to take a set of plans that I designed and make the final product. His emphasis was always on detail.
